# mc-template
---
__A candidly cooked PaperMC template for my small & communal survival worlds.__

- Bash scripts added for convenience
- Bukkit and Paper configs adjusted to optimize for higher-performance SMPs
- Datapack for gamerules and scoreboards have been added
- Plugins have been tinkered with to our liking

Feel free to nag me with suggestions :)
